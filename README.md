# MINet
Hello! MINet is a custom algorithm that leverages NLP feature extraction on motivational interviewing conversations to automatically rate them as high- or low-quality and provide insightful feedbacks for counselors on how they can improve their practice. 
During COVID-19, counselors struggled with doubt on whether they were helping their patients in over 70% of their virtual sessions. MINet seeks to improve patent-counselor outcomes, bridging the gap between counselor doubt and patient understanding.
